# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of projects that I have worked on as part of my machine learning learning journey. Each project demonstrates the application of different machine learning algorithms and techniques on various datasets.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Linear Regression

#### 1.1 Student Performance Index Prediction
- **Description**: I have used Multiple Linear Regression to predict the Student Performance Index.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (from scratch)
  - Sklearn's SGDRegressor class
  - OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method

#### 1.2 Car Price Prediction
- **Description**: I used different regression models for Car price prediction.
- **Models Used**:
  - OLS
  - SGD
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - ElasticNet Regression

*(More projects coming soon...)*
